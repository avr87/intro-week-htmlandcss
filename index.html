          The Mkomazi National Park is a magnificent, 3,245 square kilometre
          national park in northern Tanzania. Remote and initially inaccessible,
          it was established in 1951, but never attracted the financial support
          provided for the better known wildlife strongholds such as the
          Ngorongoro Conservation Area and the Serengeti National Parks. Only
          since 1989, when the Tanzanian Government re-examined the reserve’s
          status and designated it a National Priority Project, has its true
          significance and importance been recognized. From 2021 the Rhino
          sanctuary can be visited by tourist. Nowadays it is good accessible.
          From MamboViewPoint it is only one and a half hour drive to the
          Kamakota entrance. The Mkomazi National Park is a spectacular
          wilderness. Within sight to the northwest is Mount Kilimanjaro,
          Africa’s highest summit. To the south, the Pare and Usambara Mountains
          form a dramatic backdrop and, to the north, Kenya’s vast Tsavo
          National Park shares a border with Mkomazi, making common ground for
          migratory herds of elephant, oryx and zebra during the wet season.
          Together with Tsavo, it forms one of the largest and most important
          protected ecosystems on earth. Mkomazi is the southern tip of the
          Sahel zone. It is a classic dry-country reserve of grey-green nyika
          bush, ancient baobab trees and isolated rocky hills. Elsewhere, the
          seas of bush give way to open savannah woodlands of umbrella acacias
          and mbugas – shallow valleys of grassland. The animals, too, are
          typical of the arid nyika. Giraffe, oryx, gerenuk, hartebeest, lesser
          kudu, eland, impala and Grant’s gazelle share the reserve with
          elephant, buffalo, and numerous predators, including lion, leopard and
          cheetah. In all, 78 species of mammals have been recorded. The birds
          of Mkomazi are even more numerous, with over 400 recorded species.
          Doves, hornbills, weavers and guinea-fowl are all present in large
          numbers – as well as such striking species as the martial eagle and
          violet wood-hoopoe.
